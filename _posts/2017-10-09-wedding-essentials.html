<p>Indian weddings are hard enough: three days, at least four events depending on how close you are to the happy couple, and a ridiculously heavy outfit to go with each. But then, on top of that, thereâ€™s a whole unspoken list of things we just learn to bring as we attend more and more. So, for all you ladies out there going to your first Indian wedding soon, I hope this helps!</p>

      <strong>A trusted male</strong>
      <p>During the Mehendi (henna) party, you're going to become at least partially incapacitated, so it's important to recruit a helping hand early on! This can be a relative, significant other, or anyone else you can count on. Make sure he knows the range of his responsibilities, which will include feeding you dinner, responding to important texts and calls, and fetching your key card out of your purse at the end of the night.</p>

      <strong>Extra accessories</strong>
      <p>In Indian fashion, there's no concept of "a statement piece". More is more. Long earrings and arm jewelry (bangles, bracelets, cuffs, etc.) are a must, but don't be afraid to throw in a necklace, hair piece, or even some rings! Traditional jewelry is usually worn as a set, but costume jewelry can be mixed and matched.</p>

      <strong>Dancing shoes</strong>
      <p>I realize this one may sound obvious, but I'm not just referring to shoes you can put up with for a few hours. On the day of the ceremony and reception, you could easily find yourself in the same pair from noon until dawn. Furthermore, your outfit will be tailored to reach the floor with your heels on, so it's much easier to dance with shoes than without, and people will barely see them!</p>

      <strong>Safety pins</strong>
      <p>Safety pins are essentially the structural integrity of every Indian outfit. From the pleats in your saree, to the perfect drape of your chunni (scarf), you can count on needing at least three at all times. One thing my friends were surprised by was that there are different grades of safety pins! When wearing a saree, I generally use the large ones, but otherwise the medium ones work great.</p>
