<p>I went shopping in India a while back, and noticed a drastic difference in the stores’ selections. Where I had once been shown lehenga after lehenga, I was now being pushed toward full-length gowns with traditionally embellished bodices. My online search revealed the same new category: “Indian fusion”, otherwise known as “Indowestern”.</p>

<p>Although Indian fusion started as just gowns (so, anarkalis without pants), it’s quickly grown to include modern silhouettes such as culottes, capes, and jumpsuits. Designers seem to be taking full advantage of this trend, some departing from traditional garb altogether. One of my favorites, Ridhi Mehra, does an especially good job of blending Indian and Western sensibilities in her latest two collections, Adorne and Mirabella:</p>

<p>What strikes me the most about these looks, aside from their obvious glamour, is how each one perfectly tows the line between sexy and modest. In Indian culture, women are expected to dress conservatively, and you’d be pressed to find an outfit that shows some leg. But, thanks to the long-standing tradition of wearing saris, there’s a little more leniency from the midriff up. If you look again, you'll notice that the last three outfits take full advantage of this, without overdoing it.</p>

<p>With Indian fusion, it’s much easier to gauge what’s appropriate for your particular occasion. For black-tie events, I’d stick to gowns, but otherwise I'd freely substitute styles. If you're ever unsure, simply consider the Western equivalent and whether you would feel comfortable wearing it!</p>
