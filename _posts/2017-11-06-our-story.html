        <p>A few months ago, I was in a bind. My brother was getting married in a couple weeks, and I didn’t have an outfit for the Mehendi (henna) party… I had gone to India earlier that year, but didn’t find anything I loved, and figured it wouldn’t be so bad going shopping in the states. After all, I live in New York! Boy, was I wrong.</p>
        <p>I started my search as most do: with Google. After scouring site after site, I just couldn’t find anything that made me feel good. Whether it was the price (suspiciously cheap? outrageously unaffordable?) or the return policy (none), every option seemed like a compromise. I finally bit the bullet and ordered a lehenga from the “best” retailer, never to hear from them again. I WAS HAD.</p>
        <p>A couple of weeks after the wedding, I got to thinking: it shouldn’t have to be this way! I called a designer I had worked with in the past, and explained what had happened. To my surprise, she responded with story after story of customers coming to her after experiences just like mine! An online retailer that didn’t deliver on time, a clothing company that disappeared shortly after being paid thousands of dollars… The list went on. We knew that there was a real opportunity to fix this.</p>
        <p>It’s been an insanely busy few months, from incorporation, to photo shoots, to managing TWO Instagram accounts. But, I am so excited to say that we are finally launching soon!! I can’t wait to share our amazing inventory with you, and continue to grow this company with more and more trusted designers.</p>
